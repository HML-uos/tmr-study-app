# Thesis Abstract:

The present study developed and tested a novel Android flashcard app with integrated unsupervised, auditory Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) functionality. 17 participants learned 120 artificially generated words and their English translations at their own homes using the app. Each flashcard was associated with a unique cue-sound. Participants were split into two groups using either spoken words (N = 9) or neutral notification sounds (N = 8) as cues. During three consecutive study nights, 60 out of the total 120 cue-sounds were replayed at night via the app while participants slept in their own bedrooms. Unsupervised, auditory TMR applied through the novel flashcard app did not prove effective. Participants remembered significantly more non-replayed than replayed words across all tests. Effects are already present on Test 1 before any TMR replay had happened. Memory performance significantly increases throughout the study. These gains are influenced by volume levels during nightly replay. While higher volume during Night 1 negatively impacts memory performance gains, higher volume during Night 3 has the inverse effect. These volume effects are more pronounced for the notification sound group. The number of flashcards seen during the study positively impacts memory performance. The results highlight the impact of nightly volume levels and cue-sound properties on unsupervised, auditory TMR. The app has been adapted for public use, enabling flashcard customization for private experimentation. Further research is necessary to identify the concrete circumstances enabling unsupervised, auditory TMR efficacy in the home-setting. Expanding the app to a citizen science platform could enable the generation of big datasets to identify these factors.
